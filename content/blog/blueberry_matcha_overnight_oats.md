1. In a small bowl, whisk the matcha and warm water (2 tbsp) together until a smooth consistency is formed.
2. Take the frozen berries, the yogurt, the protein powder, and the milk, and allow them to get well acquainted in a blender or food processor as you lightly pulse.
3. Once you have a delicious purée, spoon it into a container or jar and mix in the matcha paste, oats, chia seeds, and honey.
4. Slice the kiwi and layer it on top with a couple of extra raspberries and store in the fridge overnight!
